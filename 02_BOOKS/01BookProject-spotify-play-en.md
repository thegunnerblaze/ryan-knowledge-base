## 2️⃣ Why This Book — Why I Chose This Book

* I use Spotify almost every day.  
  While walking, studying, gaming, playing football, or even showering,  
  changing playlists based on my emotions has become part of my routine.
* At some point, I started wondering:  
  “How was this app made?”  
  “Why did it become so natural for so many people to use?”
* At the same time, I was planning a service called **GunnerUp**,  
  a project aimed at supporting shy and quiet Arsenal fans like myself.
* Through this book,  
  I wanted to learn how a service built around **user experience**, rather than features, is truly created.

## 3️⃣ Problem I Resonated With — The Problem I Connected With Most

> ❗ **Important**  
> The “Problem” here is not the author’s problem, but  
> **my own problem that I re-encountered through this book**.

* When thinking about a service,  
  I focused too much on *what to build*,  
  and not enough on *what kind of experience would remain in people’s memories*.
* I mistakenly believed that features themselves were the value.
* I tended to postpone thinking about stakeholders  
  (users, partners, and the surrounding industry structure).

This problem clearly reflected my own habits.  
Whenever I came up with an idea,  
I started by listing technical implementations and features first.

From the perspective of a shy person, this issue feels even bigger.  
Complex services and excessive features can be overwhelming,  
and without one clear, memorable experience, it becomes easy to walk away.

## 4️⃣ Emotional Response — Emotional Shift

* **My state before reading**:  
  I thought of GunnerUp as nothing more than a match-day alarm app.
* **The strongest emotion I felt while reading**:  
  Surprise, empathy, and a quiet sense of tension.
* **The emotion that remained after closing the book**:  
  A clear realization —  
  “The core of a service is not functionality, but experience.”

## 5️⃣ Key Insight — The Core Insight That Stayed With Me

* One important truth this book taught me:  
  **People don’t remember technology — they remember how it made them feel.**
* A perspective I had never seen before:  
  Spotify didn’t simply *provide* music;  
  it *redefined* the way people listen to music.
* A sentence I desperately needed at this moment in my life:  
  “The single moment a user experiences first decides everything.”

**Quoted Passage (Optional)**  
> “People don’t share features — they share experiences.”

## 6️⃣ Mission Connection — Connection to My Mission

* This book connects deeply to my mission of  
  **“giving courage to shy people.”**
* The courage Spotify created was the courage  
  to discover new music comfortably and without pressure.
* The courage I believe in also begins  
  in environments where people don’t have to stand out or try too hard.
* If I were to recommend this book to a shy person,  
  it would be because it shows that  
  *the world doesn’t need to change you — services can change to fit you.*

## 7️⃣ From Reading to Creating — Expanding Into Creation

Things I could create inspired by this book:

* **Game idea**:  
  A minimal, experience-driven game focused on a single emotional trigger.
* **Character**:  
  A quiet figure who changes the atmosphere with just one action.
* **Service**:  
  An experience-centered service that helps shy fans start their day without pressure.
* **System**:  
  A structure with minimal features but precisely timed emotional moments.
* **Message structure**:  
  “It doesn’t have to be complicated. This one moment is enough.”

If the core idea of this book were expressed as a project,  
it would be a structure designed around  
**“one single experience that can change an entire day.”**

## 8️⃣ Personal Reflection — A Record About Myself

* The moment in this book that felt most like me:  
  Remembering past projects where I couldn’t clearly explain the experience, only the features.
* Which part of me this book touched:  
  My habit of talking about technology instead of emotions.
* A small change in my attitude after reading:  
  I now ask myself,  
  **“What moment will people remember?”**  
  before asking, “What should I build?”

## 9️⃣ One Small Courage — Today’s Small Act of Courage

After reading this book,  
one small act of courage I can try in real life:

> On the morning of an Arsenal match day,  
> writing down the very first emotion I feel as a fan —  
> recording the *moment*, not the function.

## 🔟 Closing Note — Leaving This Book in One Sentence

This book told me,  
**“Good services solve problems, but great services leave emotions behind.”**
