2️⃣ Why This Book — Why I Chose This Book

When I listen to music, work out, or watch football,  
I always strongly feel a sense of **“being together.”**

I’ve been deeply impressed by the fact that brands and content people love for a long time  
always carry a shared emotion that goes beyond the individual.

That’s how I came across this book.  
It didn’t feel like a simple marketing guide,  
but a story about how brands take root in people’s lives.

At the same time, I was conceptualizing a service called **GunnerUp**,  
aimed at Arsenal fans around the world—  
especially **quiet, shy fans like myself**.

Through this book,  
I wanted to learn how brands connect with communities  
and how emotions can be intentionally designed.

3️⃣ Problem I Resonated With — The Problem I Connected With Most

❗ Important  
The “Problem” here is not the author’s problem, but  
**my own problem that I re-encountered through this book.**

- Focusing only on “features” in brands or services,  
  while pushing “emotion” and “relationships” to the background
- Confusing gathering people with creating a place people want to stay
- Seeing community only as an outcome,  
  not as the very way a brand exists

This problem directly reflected my own experience.  
Whenever I thought about a service or idea,  
I focused first on “what it can do,”  
not on “what kind of emotion people would share there.”

For shy people, this problem feels even bigger.  
Without a sense of belonging, it’s easy to step back,  
asking first, “Is this a place where I’m allowed to exist?”

4️⃣ Emotional Response — Emotional Shift

My state before reading:  
Viewing community as just another feature or optional add-on

The strongest emotions I felt while reading:  
Empathy, surprise, and a growing sense of direction

The emotion that remained after closing the book:  
A clear realization—  
“What I want to create isn’t a service, but a space for shared emotions.”

---

5️⃣ Key Insight — The Core Insight That Stayed With Me

One important truth this book taught me:  
Community is not a marketing tool—it *is* the brand.

A perspective I had never seen before:  
People don’t stay for information or benefits,  
but because they feel that  
“people with emotions similar to mine exist here.”

A sentence I desperately needed at this moment in my life:  
“People don’t consume brands. They choose identities they belong to.”

Quoted Passage (Optional)

“Strong brands don’t gather customers. They create culture.”

6️⃣ Mission Connection — Connection to My Mission

This book deeply connects with my mission of  
**“giving courage to shy people.”**

The courage this book talks about  
is not the courage to step forward loudly,  
but the courage that comes from feeling  
“It’s okay for me to be here.”

The courage I believe in is similar—  
even without shouting or standing out,  
courage can begin from quietly sharing support and empathy.

If I were to recommend this book to a shy person,  
it would be because I want to tell them:  
“Even if you’re quiet, even if you’re alone,  
you can already be part of a community.”

7️⃣ From Reading to Creating — Expanding Into Creation

Things I could create inspired by this book:

Game idea:  
A game where players gradually collect the feeling of “not being alone”

Character:  
A quiet character who becomes strongest when supporting the same team

Service:  
A fan-experience–focused platform  
where even shy fans can share emotions without pressure

System:  
A structure that doesn’t force participation,  
but allows connection simply through presence

Message structure:  
“Different ways of supporting, one shared heart”

If the core idea of this book were expressed as a project,  
it would be  
**a structure where fans connect quietly and naturally feel belonging.**

---

8️⃣ Personal Reflection — A Record About Myself

The moment that felt most like me:  
Wanting to join a community,  
but hesitating to speak first

Which part of me this book touched:  
The part of me that longed for connection  
while secretly feeling ashamed of that desire

A small change in my attitude after reading:  
Shifting from “I need to gather people” to  
**“I need to create emotions people want to stay with.”**

9️⃣ One Small Courage — Today’s Small Act of Courage

After reading this book,  
one small act of courage I can try in real life:

Writing down the emotions I feel on match days as an Arsenal fan—  
starting with feelings, not features.

🔟 Closing Note — Leaving This Book in One Sentence

This book told me,  
“Don’t build a brand that gathers people—  
design emotions that make people want to stay together.”
