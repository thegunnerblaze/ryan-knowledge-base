## 2️⃣ Problem — The Issue This Game Addresses

In my real life, school was not a safe place for learning.  
Instead, it was filled with fear, pressure, and emotional wounds.

This problem appeared most strongly in situations involving violence from delinquent students, overwhelming academic demands, and teachers who were emotionally distant and unresponsive.

For introverted and timid students, these experiences are especially difficult.  
They tend to internalize fear, remain silent, and feel trapped—unable to escape or speak out.

This project began with the question:

> **“When school becomes the most frightening place,  
> how can we move forward within it?”**

## 3️⃣ Player Insight

* **Target Player**:  
  Players who have experienced fear, trauma, or emotional pressure within school environments

* **Player’s Starting Emotional State**:  
  Anxiety, tension, and a sense of being trapped

* **Player’s Greatest Fear**:  
  Being hurt, misunderstood, or stuck in an environment they cannot escape

## 4️⃣ Game Goal — Desired Player Change

* **Desired Feeling After Completion**:  
  The realization that moving forward is still possible, even with emotional wounds

* **Remaining Question / Message**:  

> You are not alone—and continuing forward, even slowly, is meaningful.

## 5️⃣ Core Mechanic — Expressing the Problem Through Play

* **Core Action**:  
  Navigating through a maze-like school environment while avoiding obstacles

* **Connection to the Problem**:  
  The player cannot remove or fight the obstacles.  
  Instead, they must endure, avoid, and keep moving—reflecting how students survive fear and trauma rather than confronting it head-on.

  Move through the school maze toward the end point

* **Stage / Chapter Structure**:  
  A single continuous maze composed of classrooms, hallways, and obstacles

  but affirms that moving forward is still possible

  Oppressive, tense, and emotionally heavy

  Closed spaces, rigid structures, and unsettling environmental cues
