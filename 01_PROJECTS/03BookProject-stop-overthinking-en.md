# 📚 Book Project 03 — *Stop Overthinking*

This record is not just a book review,  
but **a trace of thought that connects my mission to my next creation**.

---

## 1️⃣ Book Basics

* **Book Title**: *Stop Overthinking*
* **Author**: Nick Trenton
* **Purpose of Reading**: Mission / Project / Personal Growth
* **Reading Period**: (Author’s record)

### One-line Summary (My Version)

> This book asked me,  
> **“What if thinking doesn’t disappear before action—but weakens because of action?”**

---

## 2️⃣ Why This Book — Why I Chose This Book

* I am naturally someone who thinks a lot.  
  Before making any decision, I imagine countless scenarios, which easily leads to anxiety.
* Especially when starting something new or standing in front of people,  
  thoughts like *“What if I fail?”* or *“What if I look awkward?”* never leave my head.
* I am currently planning a service called **GunnerUp**,  
  whose mission is to give courage to shy, quiet, and introverted people like myself.
* Through this book, I wanted to find a clue to  
  **how someone who overthinks can still take action**.

## 3️⃣ Problem I Resonated With — The Problem I Connected With Most

> ❗ **Important**  
> The “Problem” here is not the author’s problem, but  
> **my own problem that I re-encountered through this book**.

* Being trapped by excessive thinking
* Refusing to act unless I feel perfectly prepared
* Imagining others’ judgments and failing to even start

This problem directly reflected my own experience.  
I have postponed action many times under the excuse of “thinking carefully,”  
only to miss opportunities along the way.

For shy people, this problem feels even bigger.  
Thinking disguises itself as *prudence*,  
but in reality, it often becomes **a safe hiding place for anxiety and fear**.

## 4️⃣ Emotional Response — Emotional Shift

* **My state before reading**:  
  Stuck in place, believing I was not “ready enough”
* **The strongest emotion I felt while reading**:  
  Empathy, discomfort, and gradually, courage
* **Emotion after closing the book**:  
  A light but firm thought — *“Maybe it’s okay to move a little now.”*

---

## 5️⃣ Key Insight — The Core Insight That Stayed With Me

* One important truth this book taught me:  
  **Overthinking is not a personality trait, but a habit born from anxiety.**
* A perspective I had never seen before:  
  Instead of trying to control thoughts,  
  **you can weaken them through action**.
* A sentence I desperately needed at this moment in my life:  
  “Confidence comes after action.”

**Quoted Passage (Optional)**  
> “Don’t try to control your thoughts—wear them down with action.”

---

## 6️⃣ Mission Connection — Connection to My Mission

* This book strongly connects to my mission of  
  **“giving courage to shy people.”**
* The courage this book talks about and the courage I believe in share one core idea:  
  courage does not begin with grand determination,  
  but with **small, imperfect actions**.
* I would recommend this book to a shy person because it says:  
  *“There is nothing wrong with you for thinking too much—you just haven’t moved yet.”*

## 7️⃣ From Reading to Creating — Expanding Into Creation

Things I could create inspired by this book:

* **Game idea**:  
  A system where thinking too long drains time, but acting changes the situation
* **Character**:  
  Someone surrounded by endless thought bubbles that disappear only when they move
* **Service**:  
  A platform that rewards first actions rather than polished results
* **System**:  
  An interface where the “Start” button is more visible than the “Plan” button
* **Message structure**:  
  “Start even if it’s imperfect.”

If the core idea of this book became a project,  
it would be a structure that **helps people act before they overthink**.

---

## 8️⃣ Personal Reflection — A Record About Myself

* The moment that felt most like me:  
  Delaying a project because “the idea isn’t perfect yet”
* The part of me this book touched:  
  The habit of justifying inaction as careful thinking
* A small change in my attitude after reading:  
  Shifting from *“start after perfection”* to **“complete by starting.”**

## 9️⃣ One Small Courage — Today’s Small Act of Courage

After reading this book,  
one small act of courage I can try in real life:

> **Actually building one tiny feature of GunnerUp.**  
> Not aiming for quality—just existence.

## 🔟 Closing Note — Leaving This Book in One Sentence

This book told me,  
**“The way out of thinking is not to stop thinking, but to start moving.”**
