## 2️⃣ Problem — The Problem I Felt

Soccer has always been an essential part of my life.  
It is not just a sport I enjoy watching and playing—it is a space where I feel free.

However, there were many days when I could not go outside to play soccer because the air quality was too poor.  
Fine dust and pollution made outdoor activity unsafe.

This repeated experience made me realize a deeper problem:

* Air pollution directly limits our ability to enjoy everyday activities.
* It affects not only physical health, but also emotions and mental well-being.
* Despite its seriousness, air pollution is often treated as an abstract or distant issue.

For me, polluted air felt **suffocating**, both physically and emotionally.

---

## 3️⃣ Why This Project

I wanted to respond to this problem through something that was deeply personal yet universally understandable.

Soccer felt like the right medium because:

* It is globally recognized.
* It represents joy, freedom, and unity.
* The moment of a **penalty kick** carries extreme pressure and tension.

I saw a strong parallel between:

* The suffocating pressure of taking a penalty kick  
* The suffocating reality of living in polluted air

Visual art allowed me to express this emotional pressure instantly, without relying on explanation or statistics.

## 4️⃣ Project Goal

* Raise awareness about air pollution through visual storytelling
* Make an invisible environmental crisis emotionally visible
* Connect environmental issues to everyday human experiences
* Show how pollution threatens even the things we love most

This project asks:

> **How can visual art, using soccer as a symbol, raise awareness about air pollution?**

## 5️⃣ Solution — My Proposed Approach

I created a watercolor painting titled **Penalty Kick**, using the most tense moment in soccer to mirror the urgency of air pollution.

Key ideas:

* A goalkeeper wearing a gas mask represents survival in a polluted world
* Reflections in the mask lenses show factories and smoke
* The green soccer field contrasts sharply with the gray, polluted sky

The visual tension forces the viewer to confront pollution as something immediate and unavoidable.

## 6️⃣ What I Built

* **Artwork**: Watercolor painting on paper
* **Medium**: Watercolor
* **Tools**: Watercolor paints, brushes, high-quality paper
* **Process**:
  * Research on air pollution (WHO and environmental organizations)
  * Visual reference studies of gas masks and polluted environments
  * Multiple composition sketches
  * Final painting with emphasis on reflection details

---

## 7️⃣ Outcome & Observation

* The artwork successfully conveyed the emotional weight of air pollution
* Viewers reported feelings of discomfort, aligning with the theme of suffocation
* Many were surprised that a soccer scene could communicate environmental urgency
* The work sparked discussions about:
  * The future of sports
  * Psychological effects of pollution
  * Environmental responsibility

The problem became **personal rather than distant** for many viewers.

---

## 8️⃣ Learnings

* Environmental problems are not only scientific or political, but deeply emotional
* Art can communicate urgency faster than data alone
* Personal experiences can become powerful entry points into global issues

I also learned that my own frustration and helplessness could be transformed into meaningful expression.

---

## 9️⃣ Mission Connection

This project aligns with my mission:

> **To give courage to people who feel limited, pressured, or silenced by their environment.**

By visualizing suffocation, this artwork encourages viewers to confront reality and recognize the need for change—even when the situation feels overwhelming.

---

## 🔟 Questions for the Next Step

* How can environmental issues be explored through interactive or immersive media?
* How can art move beyond problem awareness and visualize solutions?
* How can familiar human activities continue to serve as bridges to global issues?
