## 2️⃣ Problem — The Problem I Felt

After watching an Arsenal match,  
I rarely felt like I had truly *participated* in it.

I definitely watched the game until the end,  
and I definitely felt something.  
But the space that followed was always loud.

- Instagram comments  
- Aggressive reactions  
- A mood where you can only speak if you win  
- A structure where only emotional, outspoken people are visible  

In that space, I was always just someone watching.  
Because I didn’t speak,  
it felt like I left no trace at all,  
as if I had simply let the match pass by.

This problem feels heavier for people like me who are:
- quiet  
- slow to speak up  
- used to organizing emotions internally  

The most uncomfortable part was this:  
**if you don’t speak, it’s treated as if you didn’t participate.**

## 3️⃣ Why This Project — Why This Project

I felt that this problem couldn’t be solved by better writing prompts  
or improved community rules.

Most existing approaches require you to:
- speak well  
- state your opinion clearly  
- accept reactions and responses  

But what I wanted wasn’t training in expression.  
It was **acknowledgment of presence**.

That’s why I wanted to solve this problem not as a “community,”  
but as a **service that records quiet participation**.

---

## 4️⃣ Project Goal — The Goal of This Project

The goal of Gunner Up is simple.

* To give the feeling that participation is possible without speaking  
* To record not whether you did well, but that you didn’t just pass by  
* To value presence over intensity of emotion  

The change I want users to feel is this:

- “I didn’t say anything, but I was there for this match.”  
- “I didn’t let this feeling disappear.”  
- “Up or Down, I still participated.”

---

## 5️⃣ Solution — The Proposed Solution

Gunner Up asks for only **one very small choice per match**.

### Core Idea

- After a match, the user:
  - chooses **Up** or **Down**
  - optionally leaves a one-line comment
- No other action is required

### Meaning of Up

In Gunner Up, **Up** does NOT mean:
- growth  
- improvement  
- positivity  

Instead:

> **Up is a quiet signal  
> that the match felt good to you that day.**

Down is not a failure either.  
It is simply another way of participating by leaving the feeling as it was.

---

## 6️⃣ Implementation (What I Made)

* **What I built**
  - Match-based record pages  
  - Up / Down selection UI  
  - One-line comment input  
  - Personal match log (private)

* **Tools / Technologies Used**
  - WordPress  
  - BuddyPress (user system)  
  - WP ULike (Up / Down)  
  - Advanced Custom Fields (one-line comment, visibility)  
  - Custom Post Type (Match)

* **Working Approach**
  - Designed with “participation without speaking” as the top priority  
  - Removed comparison, comments, and evaluation features  
  - Default state is always private  

---

## 7️⃣ Outcome & Observations

The project is not complete yet,  
but one thing became very clear during the design process.

- Participation doesn’t require making noise  
- A single choice can be a sufficient record  
- The feeling of “being left behind” disappears when something remains  

One Up button can be more honest  
than a whole sentence.

---

## 8️⃣ Learnings

* **What I learned about the problem**
  - Shyness is not something to overcome,  
    but something that can become a design principle  

* **What I learned about myself**
  - I feel safer with traces than with words  
  - I didn’t want to avoid participating—  
    I wanted a form of participation that wasn’t risky  

---

## 9️⃣ Mission Connection

Gunner Up tells quiet people this:

> “You don’t have to speak.”  
> “One Up is enough.”  
> “You were already participating.”

This project gives courage  
not by forcing a first statement,  
but by **acknowledging presence first**.

---

## 🔟 Questions to Carry Forward

* What meaning will accumulated Up and Down records have over time?  
* How can this quiet participation be visualized?  
* Is connection possible among people who choose not to speak?
