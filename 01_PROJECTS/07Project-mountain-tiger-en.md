## 2️⃣ Problem — The Issue This Game Addresses

People often stop moving forward because of fear.

Even when the goal is clear, fear of failure, pressure from the environment, and self-doubt can prevent taking the next step.  
This problem becomes especially strong when facing unavoidable milestones, such as exams or major life decisions.

For introverted or timid people, fear often appears as quiet hesitation rather than dramatic conflict.  
It is the moment when the body freezes, even though the path forward is visible.

This project begins with the question:

> **“What happens when fear blocks the path in front of us?”**
