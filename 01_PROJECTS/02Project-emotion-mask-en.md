# 🎭 Project 02: Emotion Mask (Blaze)

---

## 1️⃣ Basic Project Information

* **Project Name**: Emotion Mask
* **Character Name**: Blaze
* **Project Type**: 3D Character / Mask Design / Video Project
* **Status**: Completed
* **Period**: (To be filled)

### One-line Summary

> A project where I created a 3D mask that expresses emotions through facial changes and movement, as a substitute for myself who finds it difficult to show emotions.

---

## 2️⃣ Problem — The Problem I Felt

I feel emotions deeply, but I struggle to express them through my face.

* My facial expressions barely change.
* I am often misunderstood because I don’t show emotions clearly.
* People sometimes feel uncomfortable or hesitant approaching me.

Especially emotions like joy, anger, and sadness do not appear clearly on my face, which led me to hear comments such as:

> *“I can’t tell what you’re thinking”* or *“You look cold.”*

This was not just a personality issue,  
but felt more like **a blocked channel between myself and the world for exchanging emotions**.

---

## 3️⃣ Why This Project

This project did not begin with a clear intention.

During class, a **coat hook** I happened to notice caught my attention.  
The two circles looked like eyes, and the split structure felt cute, almost like an octopus.

Drawn to its shape, I started sketching without much thought,  
and naturally, a **masked figure** emerged.

Afterward, I asked myself:

> *“Can I make this something meaningful to me?”*

At that moment, the problem I had struggled with for the longest time—**expressing emotions**—came to mind.

---

## 4️⃣ Project Goal

* To find a way to express emotions **without hiding them**
* To not deny my quiet and reserved nature
* To create a medium that can speak emotions on my behalf

The goal of this project was not to exaggerate emotions, but

> to send a signal to the world saying, *“This is how I feel right now.”*

---

## 5️⃣ Solution — My Proposed Approach

I chose the **mask** as a medium.

* Covering my face made me feel more comfortable
* It could express emotions on my behalf
* It could show emotions more clearly than my real face

The mask expresses five emotions:

* Joy
* Sadness
* Anger
* Surprise
* Fear

The name of this mask is **Blaze**.

## 6️⃣ What I Built

* **Form Inspiration**: A coat hook found at school (octopus-like structure)
* **Emotion Sketches**: Facial expression drawings based on human face references
* **Design Tools**: iPad + Procreate
* **3D Modeling / Retopology / Materials**: Blender
* **Emotion Expression System**:
  
  * Mouth: Synchronized with real facial movement  
  * Antennas: Rise and fall depending on emotion  
  * Eyes & side structures: Shape changes by emotion  

* **Color Choice**: Black (simplicity + emphasis on emotion)

---

## 7️⃣ Outcome & Observation

* The concept of wearing a mask itself provided strong psychological comfort.
* I gained the feeling that **it is okay to express emotions rather than hide them**.
* Blaze became a representative of my emotions, not my face.

This mask does not immediately solve the real-world problem, but

> it changed my perception to: *“I am not someone who cannot express emotions.”*

---

## 8️⃣ Learnings

* There is no single correct way to express emotions.
* Emotions are communicated not through the face, but through **intention and structure**.
* My timidity was not a flaw to be hidden, but a signal asking for a different form of expression.

---

## 9️⃣ Mission Connection

This project speaks to people who shrink back because they struggle to express emotions.

* It’s okay to speak less.
* It’s okay if your face looks stiff.
* Expressing yourself in a different way is more than enough.

**Emotion Mask** is  
an interface that connects timid people with the world through emotion.

---

## 🔟 Questions for the Next Step

* Could this mask expand into a game or a performance tool?
* What if additional emotions or states (anxiety, calmness, etc.) were added?

---

## 🧠 Personal Notes

* Blaze steps forward for me when I want to hide.
* Creating this mask was the first time I felt like I was *designing emotions*.

> 🎭 *Sometimes, wearing a mask makes it easier to be honest.*
