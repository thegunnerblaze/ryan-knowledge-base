# ⚽ Project 01: Soccer Friends

---

## 1️⃣ Basic Project Information

* **Project Name**: Soccer Friends
* **Project Type**: 3D Character Design / Video Project
* **Status**: Completed
* **Period**: (To be filled)

### One-line Summary

> A project where I created my own soccer friend to play with, because I wanted to play soccer but had no one to play with.

## 2️⃣ Problem — The Problem I Felt

I really love soccer.  
I especially enjoy watching Arsenal matches.  
Whenever I see players cooperating to score goals, I feel a strong urge to go outside and kick a ball myself.

However, there was a problem in reality.

* I had no friends to play soccer with.
* Starting a conversation or asking someone to play together felt difficult.
* Because of my timid personality, I couldn’t easily imagine myself going to play soccer alone.

Soccer is something you *can* play alone,  
but it becomes much more enjoyable when there is a sense of **playing together**.

That absence felt like a surprisingly big problem to me.

## 3️⃣ Why This Project

I didn’t want to solve this problem by simply telling myself to “make friends.”

That was because I already had something I was good at.

> **Creating 3D graphics and characters.**

I wanted to approach this problem in a way that felt natural to me, using my own strengths.

So I thought:

> *“What if I create my own soccer friend?”*

This project was not an act of avoidance,  
but an attempt to take a small step forward **in my own way**.

---

## 4️⃣ Project Goal

* To gain the feeling that I could enjoy soccer even when alone
* To reframe timidity not as a weakness, but as a different starting point
* To express my emotions and situation through creation

When the project ended, I hoped to be left with one simple experience:

> *“At least, I played soccer.”*

---

## 5️⃣ Solution — My Proposed Approach

The solution of this project was simple.

* Create my own soccer friend character
* Stage a situation where I play soccer **together with that character**, as if it were real
* Complete the experience in the form of a video

The character’s name is **Jerk**.

Jerk carries my loneliness, imagination, and courage all at once.

## 6️⃣ What I Built

* **Character Sketch**: iPad + Procreate
* **3D Modeling / Sculpting / Retopology**: Blender
* **Materials & Textures**: Created by myself
* **Costume**: Designed and applied my favorite **Arsenal uniform**
* **Filming**: Recorded myself playing soccer at a real soccer field
* **Editing**: Composited and edited the footage to look like I was playing soccer with Jerk

---

## 7️⃣ Outcome & Observation

* I actually went out to a soccer field and played.
* Even though I was alone, I didn’t feel alone.
* Jerk wasn’t good at soccer, but playing together was still fun.
* Even the idea of “having someone with me” made the experience feel lighter.

This project did not completely solve the problem,  
but it **clearly helped me take one step forward**.

---

## 8️⃣ Learnings

* Courage does not always have to come from other people.
* The skills I have can become tools for overcoming emotional barriers.
* Even an imaginary friend can be meaningful to me.

---

## 9️⃣ Mission Connection

This project shows another way introverted people can connect with the world.

* It’s okay if you can’t approach others first.
* It’s okay to start in your own way.
* What matters most is the experience of having **started**.

**Soccer Friends** is a project that does not deny timidity,  
but embraces it through creation.

---

## 🔟 Questions for the Next Step

* Could this character play other sports with me next?
* Could this experience be expanded into a game or interactive content?

---

## 🧠 Personal Notes

* I still clearly remember the moment I went to the soccer field alone.
* Jerk was not just a character—it was myself on that day.

> ⚽ *This friend isn’t great at soccer, but playing together was still fun.*
