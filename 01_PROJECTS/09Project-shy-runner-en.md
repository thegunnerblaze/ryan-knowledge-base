## 2️⃣ Problem — The Issue This Game Addresses

I often want to change myself,  
but when it comes time to actually act, my emotions stop me.

* Realizing my weight keeps increasing, yet wanting to look away
* Knowing I should exercise, but endlessly postponing it
* Feeling embarrassed when starting something alone in a public space

Places like the Han River—  
where everyone seems fit, confident, and experienced—  
make introverted people shrink even more.

> *“Is it okay for me to be here?”*  
> *“Do I look out of place?”*

This game is not about running itself,  
but about the **mental struggle of starting**.

---

## 3️⃣ Player Insight

* **Target players**:
  * People who keep postponing exercise
  * People who feel guilty about self-care
  * Introverted or shy individuals who are sensitive to others’ eyes

The player already knows:
* Exercise is good
* They want to change

But at the same time, they fear:
* Failing
* Being judged
* Getting tired and giving up

**Taking the first step is the scariest part.**

---

## 4️⃣ Game Goal — Desired Player Change

* **Desired feeling after play**:
  * “It’s okay to be imperfect.”
  * “Once I start, it’s not as bad as I imagined.”

* **Message to leave behind**:

> **The hardest part of running  
> isn’t the run itself—it’s stepping outside in the first place.**

---

## 5️⃣ Core Mechanic — Expressing the Problem Through Play

The core mechanic is **running while constantly facing temptation**.

* Auto-running 2D runner gameplay
* Avoid obstacles, runners, and cyclists to keep going
* Collect food items:
  * Some increase score
  * Some slow the player down
  * Some give temporary boosts

This creates direct emotional experiences:
* Temptation during self-improvement
* Wavering between goals and rewards
* Self-justification like “Just this once is fine”

---

## 6️⃣ Game Structure

* **Progression**:
  * 2D side-scrolling runner
  * 3 hits → Game Over

* **Time Flow**:
  * Morning → Sunset → Night
  * The longer you run, the more time passes

* **Difficulty Curve**:
  * More runners and cyclists appear
  * Food choices become more frequent

---

## 7️⃣ Narrative & World

The game is set along the **Han River in Seoul**.

* A place full of people
* A space dominated by skilled runners and cyclists
* At the same time, a place filled with temptation:
  * Ramen
  * Fried chicken
  * Tteokbokki

The protagonist is not a hero.

* Just an ordinary person facing their own body
* A beginner runner wearing new shoes, awkwardly moving forward

The ending is not about distance or score.

> It’s about being able to say,  
> **“I ran today.”**

---

## 8️⃣ Art & Mood

* **Overall atmosphere**:
  * Humorous
  * Relatable
  * Light, but honest

* **Visual style**:
  * 2D cartoon style
  * Soft pastel colors
  * Exaggerated character animations:
    * Sweating
    * Heavy breathing
    * Blushing when passing others

* **Safety elements**:
  * No punishment-heavy tone
  * Failure presented with humor, not shame

---

## 9️⃣ Outcome — How the Game Responds to the Problem

Through play, the player experiences:
* Not pressure to perform well
* But the act of **continuing anyway**

The courage gained is small but real:
* Wanting to visit the Han River someday
* Remembering their running shoes
* Thinking, “Maybe I can try once.”

The game doesn’t solve the problem completely, but:

> **It lowers the fear of starting—just once.**

---

## 🔟 Mission Connection

**The Shy Runner** is a practice space for introverted people.

* Practicing continuing despite embarrassment
* Practicing moving forward without confidence
* Practicing persistence amid temptation and doubt

This game says:

> **Courage doesn’t have to be grand.  
> One more step is enough.**

---

## 🧠 Personal Notes

* The protagonist is myself.
* I poured in my embarrassment, breathlessness, and craving for ramen at the Han River.
* The moment I empathized with most:
  * The thought of “Should I just go home?”
  * Versus the excuse, “I’ll run just for the ramen.”

> 🏃 *This is not a game about running fast.*  
> *It’s a game about starting to run at all.*
