## 2️⃣ Problem — The Issue This Game Addresses

I am a quiet and introverted person.

Even when I have many thoughts, interests, and emotions inside me, they rarely come out naturally.  
Because of this, people often see only silence, not what exists beneath it.

This problem appears most strongly when:

* I want to express myself but cannot find the right words
* I feel pressure to explain myself clearly and quickly
* Silence is misunderstood as emptiness

For introverted people, this problem is especially difficult because:

* Inner richness is often invisible
* Being quiet is easily mistaken for having nothing to say
* Explaining oneself can feel exhausting or unnatural

This project begins with one question:

> **What if my inner self could be experienced as a place, rather than explained with words?**

---

## 3️⃣ Player Insight

* **Target Player**: Quiet, introverted, or emotionally reserved people
* **Starting Emotional State**:
  * Curiosity
  * Slight loneliness
  * Calm uncertainty
* **Player’s Core Fear**:
  * Being unseen
  * Being misunderstood
  * Having inner meaning go unnoticed

---

## 4️⃣ Game Goal — Desired Player Change

After finishing the game, the player should:

* Feel that silence can still hold meaning
* Accept that not everything needs to be explained clearly
* Carry a lingering emotional aftertaste rather than a clear answer

The game leaves the player with this feeling:

> Some worlds are quiet, but that does not mean they are empty.

---

## 5️⃣ Core Mechanic — Expressing the Problem Through Play

* **Core Action**: Walking slowly through a silent exhibition space
* **Player Behavior**:
  * Observing
  * Pausing
  * Interacting gently

The lack of urgency and dialogue represents:

* The difficulty of expressing inner thoughts
* The comfort of being allowed to exist quietly
* Meaning emerging through presence, not explanation

---

## 6️⃣ Game Structure

### Entry

* The player spawns outside a soccer stadium
* They stand in front of a **ticket booth**
* The player must **purchase a ticket** to enter

The ticket symbolizes permission to enter my inner world.

### Progression

* The player enters the stadium
* The green field is **not** the exhibition space
* Instead, the player walks clockwise along the **circular outer ring**
* Exhibitions are encountered one by one in sequence

### Ending

* After viewing all exhibitions, the player exits the stadium
* At that exact moment, a large crowd enters
* The player and the crowd cross paths
* The game ends

---

## 7️⃣ Narrative & World

### World Symbolism

* **Soccer Stadium**: My inner world
* **Silence**: Emotional restraint
* **Empty seats**: Unshared thoughts
* **Crowd at the end**: External world and social noise

A stadium is usually loud and energetic, but here it is:

* Empty
* Silent
* Still

This irony reflects how my inner world feels.

### Post-Ending Change (Hope)

If the player re-enters the stadium after finishing the game:

* The stadium is full
* The atmosphere is bright and lively
* Silence is replaced by presence

This change represents **hope**.

---

## 8️⃣ Art & Mood

* **Atmosphere**: Quiet, reflective, slightly melancholic
* **Narrative Style**: Minimal, indirect
* **Sound Design**:
  * Ambient sounds
  * Lingering music
  * Long silences
* **Emotional Safety**:
  * No failure
  * No pressure
  * No forced interpretation

The game avoids clear explanations to allow personal interpretation.

---

## 9️⃣ Outcome — How the Game Responds to the Problem

The courageous action the player performs is simple:

* Entering
* Staying
* Walking through silence

The game responds to the problem by proving that:

* Silence can still communicate
* Meaning does not require noise
* Inner worlds are valid, even when unseen

---

## 🔟 Mission Connection

This game functions as a **practice space for quiet courage**.

It tells introverted players:

> You don’t need to be loud to
